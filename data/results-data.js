    sign: 'aries',
    planet: 'sun',
    story: 'As a fire symbol, Aries suggests aggression, confidence, energy, and courage. Aries folks meet life head on. They are also the youngest of all the signs and often approach the world with a childlike wonder. That newness can be refreshing, like the spring after a long and cold winter. It can also bring a sense of naivite that can be charming and also frustrating due their common lack of follow through. Those born under the Aries Sun are often leaders, in fact the leaders of the leaders. These self-starters know how to get you out of a jam.'

    story: 'Sweet determined Taurus, things never go unfinished when you are around. Folks born under a Taurus sun are the epitome of determination and maybe more than a little stubborn. These bulls cannot be rushed, but never fear, they will cross that finish line. Taureans tend to be the most sensual of the earth signs, seeking through their senses, particularly touch. Taurus natives also tend to have a very particular knack for finding beauty and comfort in physical possessions and earthly abundance.'

    story: 'Oh chatty Gemini! Your curiosity, need for collecting information, and extreme self-expression are all strong qualities. Gemini suns tend to be witty, adaptable, and clever, but can also be superficial and flighty. They get the bad rep of being two-faced, but this dual nature can also serve a Gemini well, allowing them to adapt to new situations and communicate in innovative ways. Speaking of communication, Mercury rules Gemini and has a knack for getting his point across. All this being said, people tend to like being around Geminis, even if they do not want to admit it.'

    story: 'Squishy tender Cancer. You take that #crablife seriously with your strong survival instinct and protective streak. You carry your home with you wherever you go and yet keep it hidden within that outer shell. Some people think a Cancer sun is moody, but they know that they are just trying to stay secure in an insecure world.'
