# astro-learning

## Version 1.0.0 
This is a very basic vanilla javascript app to help folks learn how a little bit about astrology. I utizilized concepts learned in the first bootcamp from Alchemy Code Lab including using local storage, manipulating arrays with array methods, and basic HTML and CSS styling. 

I am continually adding to the data for this app.
